Integrating SQL into your Core Java projects can add robustness and flexibility to your applications. Here are some project ideas that combine Core Java with SQL:

Online Shop Management System: Develop a system where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and make purchases. Use SQL to manage product inventory, user accounts, and order history.

Hospital Management System: Build a comprehensive system to manage patient records, appointments, medical history, and billing. SQL can be used to store and retrieve patient data efficiently.

Social Media Application: Create a basic social media platform where users can create profiles, connect with friends, post updates, and interact with each other. SQL databases can store user profiles, posts, comments, and friendship connections.

E-commerce Platform: Design a full-fledged e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and make purchases. SQL databases can manage product catalogs, user accounts, orders, and payments.

Blog Platform: Build a blogging platform where users can create and publish blog posts, follow other users, and interact through comments. SQL can be used to store blog posts, user profiles, comments, and follower relationships.

Fitness Tracker: Develop an application to track fitness activities such as workouts, diet plans, and progress measurements. SQL databases can store user profiles, activity logs, and progress data for analysis.

Employee Attendance System: Create a system to track employee attendance, including clock-in/out times, leaves, and overtime. SQL databases can store employee records and attendance data for reporting and analysis.

Online Learning Platform: Build a platform where users can access educational content, enroll in courses, and track their progress. SQL can manage course catalogs, user profiles, enrollment data, and learning progress.

Inventory Tracking System for a Retail Store: Develop a system to track inventory levels, sales, and restocking needs for a retail store. SQL databases can manage product inventory, sales transactions, and supplier information.

Recipe Management Application: Create an application to store and organize recipes, including ingredients, instructions, and user ratings. SQL databases can manage recipe data and user preferences for personalized recommendations.

By combining Core Java with SQL, you can create powerful and scalable applications that handle data efficiently and provide valuable functionality to users.
